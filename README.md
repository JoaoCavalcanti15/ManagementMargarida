# ManagementMargarida
This project does not have a pre-defined database. For it to function you should insert an url to your own MongoDB database. To do so, change the variable mongodb in the file /server/.env

We recommend the usage of the service Mongo Atlas for this purpose.

# Server
To run the server, navigate to server directory on terminal and prompt 'npm start'. 

# Client
To run the client, navigate to server directory on terminal and prompt 'npm start'. 

PS: For running you need to prompt 'npm install' before, otherwise you won't have node_modules in the project's folder.
